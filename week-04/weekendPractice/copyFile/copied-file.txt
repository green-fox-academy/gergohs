Oh, I think I've landed
In a world I hadn't seen
When I'm feeling ordinary
When I don't know what I mean

Oh, I think I've landed
Where there are miracles at work
For the thirst and for the hunger
Come the conference of birds

And say it's true
It's not what it seems
Leave your broken windows open
And in the light just streams
