Oh lord please lift me up to the night sky
So I can touch those shiny stars.
Wanna dance to the vibes of frozen Pluto,
Throwing crumbs to the mice on Mars.
Wanna sing you a love song, a beautiful love song
About Venus' other side,
Wanna eat up the Moon and turn to silver,
Shine through Tau Ceti's lights.
